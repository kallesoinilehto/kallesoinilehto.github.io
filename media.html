  <p class="narrow-text">Before I made the decision to begin studying ICT, I was studying in the media industry. There I got a lot of experience from its different aspects.
   I did interviews, made storyboards and even acted. The biggest project was planning an interview video from scratch and
   writing an article related to its topics. It is worth to mention my participation in the finnish YouTube channel Kiimeli, where I worked as a camera man for a year.
